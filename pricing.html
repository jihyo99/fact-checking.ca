                        <strong>Exercise 1- Understanding the Spread on Misinformation Through Altmetrics </strong><br>

                        <p class="fw-normal  mb-0">Altimetric's is a tool like other bibliometrics used to track engagement with publications, however it adds the the tracking of communication channels outside of traditional scholarly channels. Meaning statistical analysis includes voices of both academics and the public allowing for a greater understanding of the impact of research. Some of the sources included are; scholarly citations, patent citations, blog mentions, news media mentions, Wikipedia references, YouTube mentions, public policy citations, social media mentions/shares

                            A major factor in the dissemination of misinformation is understanding the effect that academic publications have outside academic spheres. Many people define there opinions and beliefs based on major issues such as genetic testing, politics, and LGBTQ rights, based on the media they consume on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit etc. Online journalism is largely funded through engagement, traditional news sources have been responsible for convoluting facts, misinterpreting, or reporting on incomplete aspects of scientific studies, highlighting unusual claims to boost engagement. Individuals are even more likely convoluted academic reports, spreading misinformation under the vale of academic soundness. At its core altimetric allows for students and academics to break free from their information eco chambers having a window into the conversations being had after research is published; contributing to understanding how misinformation is spread and how the misinterpretation purposefully of negligently contributes to misinformation online.

                            <br><strong>Student learning outcomes: </strong><br> 
                            1. Locate the original research article (e.g., Wakefield’s study) mentioned in the video using an online metrics tool or Altmetric Explorer for Institutions (subscription) [https://www.altmetric.com/ products/explorer-for-institutions/]) <br>

2. Intentionally explore diverse perspectives that mention the original research output (e.g., Wakefield’s study) within an online metrics tool; online attention to research explored can include other scholarly as well as popular sources. <br>

3. Critically analyze the online engagement of the original research article (e.g., Wakefield’s study) and the other outputs/perspectives explored to determine the video’s relevance, accuracy, purpose, and bias based on what you’ve just explored.

    <strong>Exercise 2 - IF I APPLY Practice Exercise</strong><br>
    In order to better understand how to use the IF I APPLY method a practice assessment will be provided in order to show students how to apply this method in their own research.
    <br><strong>Instructions</strong>Out of the 2 sources provided here please choose which source you would consider credible and which you would consider to be unreliable/fake news. Please describe why you thought which source was credible using the steps and questions provided in the IF I APPLY method. Go through each step of the IF I APPLY method for both sources and then compare results in order to determine which is the more credible source of information.
