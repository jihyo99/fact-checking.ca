                                It is important to remember that every article and post you read online will have some inherent bias from those who write the information and pay to publish it online. There is no such thing as neutral information when something is published and written for an audience online; it comes from a particular perspective of a problem and is usually written for an audience who agrees with the perspective being discussed. This creates personal bias and echo chambers of information only being looked at by one view. In order to avoid this issue of bias, it is important to critically evaluate where information is coming from and who it is being written for, to understand the perspective a source of information is trying to portray and why.


PRO TIP: Inaccurate or biased sources of information can still include correct facts, but how those facts are presented can lead you believing a particular point/belief even when that is not the reality of the facts. This is where bias and misrepresentation of facts play a role in how we judge information we find online

                                The most common sources of information you will find when researching any topic online are news articles, journal articles, or articles from organizations or social media posts. Although news and online articles from websites can give accurate information, you must be careful as many pieces of fake news come from uncredited news and organization websites that come up in base-level search engines like Google. Likewise, social media posts are only a credible source of information if what has been posted cites a credible source. This is because of the anecdotal nature of social media posts; most posts can only be called facts if they cite trustworthy information (which is not common). Finally, the most trustworthy sources of information come from journal articles that can be found in online databases such as JSTOR; many databases can be accessed for free through local libraries and school accounts that allow access to university databases.

                                </a><hr>
                                The reason articles from websites in the normal search algorithms are less trustable than journal articles from online databases is due to the issue of inherent bias from those who are paying to publish articles online for public consumption. When we read information from a news or organizational website, we must remember that whoever published and paid for that article had the final say over what was presented in that source and that each organization/person has their motives for pushing certain information. Although, so well, an article may present impartial information, there is a particular way that information has been presented in order to get readers to believe in the agenda being pushed by the publisher(s).

                                <strong>1. Checking for Bias</strong>&nbsp
                                An easy way to determine if an online article has a bias (particularly in news articles) is to look at the political alignment of the news company or organization that has published the article. An overwhelming majority of fake or misleading news articles are political in nature. A surefire way to see if the article you are reading has a political bias is to check where an organization (like fox news) falls on the political spectrum. An online article can have a conservative or liberal bias, which will shape how a piece of information is presented to a reader. By understanding what type of worldview is being pushed by an organization in a news article about current events, we can understand what parts of the article present facts versus what parts present opinions as facts

One way to find out the political alignments of a news or organization that has posted an article is to look through the political news media charts that appear below in the attached worksheet titled The political bias of different news stations also helpful websites like AllSides help you identify an organization's political biases for companies that are not shown in the figures in the attached worksheet.

                                <strong>2. Wording and “Clickbaityness”</strong>
                                Another red flag to look for that will signal that the information you are reading is misleading is the wording. Fake news and other misinformation sources try to pass themselves as legitimate news sources. However, they frequently try to play on your emotions by using clickbait wording and hyperbolic headlines. For example, "you won't believe what Kim Kardashian said to the president". Researching clickbait headlines can be the first sign that an article contains misinformation. The wording within a fake news article will also tend to be more emotional and heart-string pulling than in factual news articles. This is a form of manipulation to push an agenda; this is done in order to get you emotionally invested in untrue information so you are less likely to realize it is fake.

                                <strong>Peer Reviewing in articles</strong><br>
                            </div>Journal articles that come from databases tend to be the most trustworthy sources of information about any topic. This is because a journal article published in a scientific journal or scientific database has had to have gone through an extensive process of peer review. Peer reviewing is a part of the scientific process that turns hypotheses into accepted theories. Peer reviewing is when a scientific article and its data is reviewed or recreated by other researchers within or outside of the field of study. Doing extensive peer review processes ensures that the information being presented in a journal article is as accurate and unbiased as possible to ensure that what is being presented is the truth of the matter. All articles from journals are peer-reviewed, which is why they are the most trustworthy type of article you can use as a source of information. Journal articles are most commonly found in databases (that can be accessed using student accounts) or journal search engines like google scholar.
